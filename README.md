## <h1>JMR Intorduction</h1>

JMR is a movie rental system that lets you rent movies online and features an minimalistic UI that allows its user to rent upcoming updated movies from the latest venders with a reasonable price. Featuring a cart the user can easily manage which movie to rent out or not.

## Getting Started

To begin using JMR you need to clone the repo using [Git bash](https://www.git.com).

After installing git open any folder you would like to clone to and use this command in your terminal

### `git clone https://github.com/Brainstormer-s/JMR`

### `cd JMR`

After that you can either use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://www.yarnjs.com).

### `yarn install` or `npm install`

wait for the packges to load then you can move to the next step.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start or npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test or npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build or npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject or npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
